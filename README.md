# Tkinter_GUI_Project  

This repository contains the implementation for **Lab Assignment 4** of COMP 216, divided into two separate parts:  
- **Part I: Multithreading** (Group 1)
- **Part II: Tkinter GUI Application**

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Part I (Multithreading)**
**Description:**  
This part of the lab explores multithreading in Python. We will compare **sequential execution** vs **multithreading execution** by measuring execution times.

### **ðŸ“Œ Features Implemented**
- âœ… A function that simulates a **long task** by looping **100,000 times with a small sleep delay**.  
- âœ… A function that executes this task **sequentially** and records the execution time.  
- âœ… A function that executes this task **using threads** and compares the execution time.  
- âœ… A final test that **calls both functions 10 times** and prints the performance difference.

## **ðŸ”¹ Part II (Tkinter GUI Application)**
**Description:**  
This part of the lab focuses on creating a **graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter**. The application will be **built from scratch** to meet the lab requirements.

### **ðŸ“Œ Features Implemented**
- âœ… A **Tkinter GUI** with multiple input fields, labels, and buttons.  
- âœ… A **form-based layout** to collect and display user input.  
- âœ… A functional **Submit** button that processes user data.  
- âœ… A **Reset** button to clear all input fields.  
- âœ… An **Exit** button to close the application.
